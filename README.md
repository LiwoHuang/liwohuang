Hello, my name is Liwo Huang. I am SWE student who will graduate at 2024.
I am an immigrant who just came to the United States for four years.  I am easy-going and don't care too much about gains and losses, but I often reflect on my own shortcomings and habits.  I am willing to always maintain sufficient curiosity and enthusiasm to face any new things.  Since I was Major in CS, I began to realize that I had a great passion for software development.  I hope to have the opportunity to learn more about the development of computer science industry through internship before completing my bachelor's degree.  At present, my goal is to adapt to the trend of The Times, learn and develop simple and efficient software products to meet the needs of the company.
